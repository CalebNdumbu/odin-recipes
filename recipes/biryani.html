    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a rich and fragrant rice dish layered with marinated meat and spices. It is a beloved dish in South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines, known for its complexity of flavors and textures.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>500g chicken, beef, or lamb, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust for spice level)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water or broth</li>
        <li>Optional: boiled eggs and fried onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, marinate the meat with yogurt, garlic, ginger, green chilies, turmeric, coriander powder, and salt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes (or longer for better flavor).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated meat to the pot and cook until browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, cumin seeds, and garam masala. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the spices are well combined.</li>
        <li>In another pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice, and cook until the rice is about 70% done (it should still have a slight bite). Drain the rice.</li>
        <li>Layer half of the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture in the pot. Then add the chopped cilantro and mint leaves. Layer the remaining rice on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove from heat and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fried onions and boiled eggs if desired, and serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or salad.</li>
    </ol>
