    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>500g beef or chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1-2 whole cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water or broth</li>
        <li>Optional: peas or carrots for added flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the meat (beef or chicken) to the pot and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, cumin seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder, cloves, and cardamom pods. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the spices are well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the drained rice to the pot and gently mix to coat the rice with the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or broth, add salt to taste, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>If using, add peas or carrots during the last 5 minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it sit covered for another 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Fluff the pilau with a fork and serve hot with your favorite side dishes or salad.</li>
